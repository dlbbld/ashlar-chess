## The story when releases are done

*clean-chess started as a correctness-first reference implementation, built from the FIDE rules without consulting existing libraries. It found correctness bugs in python-chess and ScalaChess along the way. Once the rules were stable, a bitboard backend was added alongside the reference layer and verified bit-exact against it. Production then switched to the bitboard path; the reference layer was relocated into the test tree and remains as the permanent differential-test oracle. Cross-validation against python-chess was reactivated as primary, with `chesslib` retained as a second witness. Only then published to Maven Central.*

## Current release - helpmate hot-path release (12.1.0) 

Mutable `HelpmateSearchBoard`, per-ply move buffers, exact transposition key.
12.0.0 made `findHelpMate` cheaper per node by collapsing the wrapper down to `HelpmateSearchBoard`, but every search move still allocates: a fresh `BitboardPosition` from `afterMove(...)`, a new `DynamicPosition`, an `ImmutableList<LegalMove>`, a `TreeSet`/`MoveSpecification`/`LegalMove` graph, and sometimes an extra `afterMove()` for EP normalization. After 12.0.0's `MoveGenerationPerformanceSurvey` baseline the production bitboard path sits at ~3.5–4× `chesslib`. This release closes the allocation gap inside `com.dlb.chess.unwinnability` only. Public `BitboardPosition` remains an immutable record; `StaticPosition` and the differential-test oracle layer are not touched.

### Goals

- `HelpmateSearchBoard` makes and unmakes moves in place — no per-move `BitboardPosition` / `DynamicPosition` / move-list allocation along the tree-search hot path.
- `getLegalMoves()` on `HelpmateSearchBoard` returns a per-ply reusable buffer with **byte-for-byte / order-equivalent** contents vs. today — the mate-line output and search cutoffs are observable behavior pinned by tests.
- Transposition cache keyed by an **exact** package-private structural key over the mutable board fields. No Zobrist as a correctness-bearing key in this release.
- `MoveGenerationPerformanceSurvey` ratio target: within ~1.5–2× of `chesslib` on the production bitboard path.

### Non-goals

- Touching `BitboardPosition` mutability, `StaticPosition`, `AbstractLegalMoves`, or any class on the differential-test oracle side.
- New public API. Every change inside the `com.dlb.chess.unwinnability` package is package-private; the only shared-layer touch this release allows is the optional Phase E behind the existing slider-attack API in `com.dlb.chess.bitboard` (see *Layer discipline* below).
- Magic bitboards as a first move. Magics are profile-gated to Phase E and only land if Phases B–D leave the ratio outside target.
- Probabilistic / Zobrist-keyed transposition tables as the first-correctness move. (Zobrist may return later, behind equality verification or explicit collision handling.)

### Layer discipline (invariant)

Sliding-attack truth lives in `com.dlb.chess.bitboard` (`BishopAttacks`, `RookAttacks`, `QueenAttacks`) and is shared by `BitboardPosition` and `HelpmateSearchBoard`. The helpmate search board does **not** get its own attack implementation — magic bitboards (if Phase E happens), any X-ray helpers added later for pins / discovered checks / king-safety probes, and any other slider-related primitives stay in the shared `com.dlb.chess.bitboard` package, hidden behind the existing `(int squareOrdinal, long occupied) -> long` API so callers do not change. `HelpmateSearchBoard` is faster because its state is mutable and its allocations are amortized — not because it carries a private parallel engine that could drift from `BitboardPosition`. Treat any PR that grows a slider / X-ray / attack helper inside `com.dlb.chess.unwinnability` as wrong by construction; lift it into `com.dlb.chess.bitboard` first.

### Move-order policy

Public `Board.getLegalMoves()` iteration order stays **stable** in this release. `Board` is published API surface; its move-list order is observable by external consumers, and we change it only via a deliberate API-visible release decision, not casually for performance.

Inside the search, **`HelpmateSearchBoard` is free to enumerate moves in any deterministic order it likes.** Iteration order is an internal performance choice for the speed work, not a semantic correctness requirement. Phase A's parity test will be relaxed from ordered-list equality to legal-move **set** equality once Phase B's make/unmake correctness gate is green (until then, ordered equality stays as a free differential guard since Phase B does not touch the move generator). Phase C's per-ply `MoveBuffer` is free to drop `TreeSet`-derived ordering and pick whatever the fast generator naturally produces.

Mate-line stability follows the same shape: the existing `TestUnwinnability{Quick,Full}HelpMateIsHelpMate` tests assert that the analyzer's mate-line, when played out, is legal and ends in checkmate for the intended winner. This release does **not** add exact-UCI-mate-line equality assertions. The helpmate algorithms — `FindHelpMateInterrupt` (depth 9) and `FindHelpmateExhaust` (node-bounded with transposition behavior) — are inherently order-sensitive in practice; changing internal move order may shift the first-found mate line, alter node counts, or occasionally flip a bounded `WINNABLE` / `UNDETERMINED` result. The product-priority output is `UNWINNABLE` (and `DEAD_POSITION`); an unsound `UNWINNABLE` regression is unacceptable. `WINNABLE` output is fragile by design and accepted as such — it depends on whether a bounded helpmate line happens to be found, and any change that does not introduce an unsound `UNWINNABLE` is in policy. Protect with state parity, terminal flags, set equality, and legal-checkmating mate-line validation. Do not protect with exact move ordering.

### Phase boundaries

- **Phase A — differential-test scaffolding for `HelpmateSearchBoard`.** Lock-step `HelpmateSearchBoard` ↔ `Board` parity across recursive trees. Default tree depth 3; depth 4 only for deliberately tiny / forced positions so failure traces stay reviewable. At every node both representations must agree on: 12 piece bitboards, side to move, raw EP, normalized EP, castling rights, cached check flags (`isCheck` / `isCheckmate` / `isStalemate`), and the legal-move **set** (ordered-list equality stays as a free differential guard through Phase B since the move generator isn't touched there; relaxes to set equality when Phase C reworks the buffer — see *Move-order policy*). Fixtures **enumerated in the test or test helper before any implementation** — failures must be reproducible by fixture name, not by "whatever the corpus happened to surface." Required categories: castling rights, legal EP, pinned/illegal EP normalization (the case the EP-normalization extra-`afterMove` exists for), promotion, in-check + evasion, double-check king-only, EP capture among legal responses to a pawn check, stalemate terminal, checkmate terminal. Mate-line validation continues to ride on the existing `TestUnwinnability{Quick,Full}HelpMateIsHelpMate` (play-the-line, assert checkmate-at-end) — Phase A does NOT pin exact UCI mate-line equality. This phase is the behavioral oracle the rest of the release rides on.

- **Phase B — mutable `HelpmateSearchBoard` + explicit undo stack.** `HelpmateSearchBoard` owns mutable 12 piece bitboards, side to move, raw EP, normalized EP, castling rights, cached derived flags. `make(move)` mutates in place; `unmake()` pops an undo record (per-ply deltas: flipped bits, captured piece, castling-rights/EP/halfmove deltas, prior cached-flag values). No per-move `BitboardPosition.afterMove(...)` allocation, no per-move `DynamicPosition` allocation, no extra `afterMove()` for EP normalization. Phase A's full differential-test set must remain green. **Additional gate: a dedicated `make → unmake` round-trip test** asserts every observable field is byte-identical to its pre-`make` value — raw EP, normalized EP, castling rights, cached check / checkmate / stalemate flags, legal-move buffer contents and count, transposition-key material. This gate has to be green before any caller switches to the mutable path.

- **Phase C — per-ply reusable `MoveBuffer`.** Replace `ImmutableList<LegalMove>` per-ply allocation with a per-depth reusable buffer. **One buffer per depth, NOT one shared global** — parent buffers must survive child recursion. Iteration order is free to follow whatever the fast generator naturally produces — the buffer is allowed to drop `TreeSet`-equivalent ordering, since *Move-order policy* (above) treats `HelpmateSearchBoard` enumeration order as an internal performance choice. Phase A's parity test relaxes from ordered-list to set equality in the same commit that ships the new buffer, so the change has a single coherent green-step boundary. Treat the returned buffer as read-only at callsites.

- **Phase D — exact structural transposition key.** Replace `HashMap<DynamicPosition, Integer>` with a package-private exact structural key over the mutable board fields, or with a custom exact table. Equality semantics match today's `DynamicPosition.equals`. Do not use public `ZobristKeys` helpers as the correctness-bearing key — Zobrist becomes a re-evaluation candidate only after this release ships and only behind explicit collision handling or equality verification.

- **Phase E (deferred, profile-gated) — magic bitboards.** Only if the post-D `MoveGenerationPerformanceSurvey` ratio is still outside the ~1.5–2× target and profiling identifies sliders as the remaining cost. The change is purely internal to `com.dlb.chess.bitboard.BishopAttacks` / `RookAttacks` — it sits behind the existing `(int squareOrdinal, long occupied) -> long` API so both `BitboardPosition.legalMoves` and `HelpmateSearchBoard` pick up the speed-up automatically, with no caller changes anywhere (see *Layer discipline* above — the magic implementation is shared, not search-board-private). Magics do not touch the larger allocation paths in `BitboardLegalMoveFactory.java:94` or `BitboardPosition.legalMoves`, which is exactly why this is last.

- **Phase F — re-measure, version bump, CHANGELOG, gates.** Re-run `MoveGenerationPerformanceSurvey` and record the new ratios in `CHANGELOG.md`. Version bump to `12.1.0` (or `13.0.0` only if a breaking change has actually surfaced — none is expected; all changes are internal to `com.dlb.chess.unwinnability`). Update `pom.xml`, both `README.md` copies, and the `CHANGELOG.md` entry. Mark this release done in `tasks.md`.

### Gates (all three green before tagging)

- `mvn test` (smoke).
- `mvn javadoc:javadoc`.
- `mvn test -Pfull -Dtest.excludes=` (full corpus, including the now-capped `TestAmbronaSemiStaticOracleComparison`).

Plus the per-phase behavioral gates: Phase A's differential and fixture-regression suites must stay green from B onward; Phase B's `make → unmake` round-trip gate must be green before any caller is switched onto the mutable path.

## Next release — drop auto-CHA-per-move; dead-position queries become request-based

The construction we have today is too complicated and does work the library doesn't need. Today every `Board.move()` (and every `Board` constructor) runs the unwinnability quick analyzer on the new position and caches the verdict in `isDeadPositionUnwinnableQuickList`. The cached value drives `Board.isDeadPositionUnwinnableQuick()`, feeds `Board.isDeadPosition()` (alongside the cheap mechanical `isInsufficientMaterial`), and through `ValidateNewMove` causes the move pipeline to throw `MoveCheck.GAME_ALREADY_ENDED` with `GameStatus.DEAD_POSITION_UNWINNABLE_QUICK` if a consumer tries to play on. The whole apparatus exists to model FIDE 5.2.2 "dead position" as an automatic termination.

**The premise the auto-termination relies on is false in practice.** Playing on in a dead position is harmless: no win is reachable, the position can only resolve to a draw. In a real game the practical outcomes are all draws — flagfall in a dead position is a draw by adjudication, resignation in a dead position is a draw under current FIDE rules (no win available to the opponent), and the players can always agree to a draw. Nothing changes if they keep moving. So the library does not need to *enforce* dead-position termination at the move-pipeline boundary; it only needs to make it *queryable* so consumers that want to surface it can do so.

The current eager-per-move construction also costs more than just complexity: it makes every move pay the analyzer cost (mitigated but not erased by the bitboard work), it adds a constructor flag (`detectDeadPositionUnwinnable`) that has to be threaded through every `Board` overload, it requires a recursion-suppression guard inside the analyzer when it builds throwaway sub-boards, and it leaks into the test corpus — fixtures get relocated to `pgnParser/legacy/common/beyond/` whenever they happen to step into a dead position even though the recorded games are otherwise well-formed PGN. The fix simplifies all of that.

### Phase 1 — Drop auto-detection from `Board`

**Step 1.1** — Remove the per-ply cache and computation. Drop `Board.isDeadPositionUnwinnableQuickList`, `Board.computeDeadPositionUnwinnableQuick()`, the `isDetectDeadPositionUnwinnable` field, every `Board` constructor overload that took the `detectDeadPositionUnwinnable` flag (including `copyCurrentPositionWithoutHistory(boolean)`), and the eager calls from `Board` constructors and `performMoveWithoutValidation`. `Board.isDeadPositionUnwinnableQuick()` as a stateful accessor is removed.

**Step 1.2** — Reshape `Board.isDeadPosition()` and the `isDeadPosition*` family as pure on-demand queries that run the analyzer when called. `isDeadPositionQuick()` and `isDeadPositionFull()` are already that today (`Board` lines ~951 / ~999); the change is that `isDeadPosition()` joins them — it computes `isInsufficientMaterial() || isDeadPositionQuick().isDeadPosition()` at the call site instead of reading a cached field. Consumers that want the old "checked after every move" behavior call the query themselves in their move loop.

**Step 1.3** — `ValidateNewMove` no longer rejects moves on `DEAD_POSITION_UNWINNABLE_QUICK`. Remove the corresponding check from the move-acceptance precondition (the auto-terminators that remain: checkmate, stalemate, insufficient material, plus fivefold and 75-move if Phase 2 below is not adopted). `MoveCheck.GAME_ALREADY_ENDED` continues to fire for the auto-terminators that survive.

**Step 1.4** — Decide the `GameStatus.DEAD_POSITION_UNWINNABLE_QUICK` enum value's fate. Two options: keep it (returned by an explicit "what status is this position in" query, never thrown by the move pipeline) or drop it (the analyzer's `UnwinnabilityQuickVerdict` is the only place that concept lives). Recommend keep, narrowed in scope — `Board.calculateGameStatus()` or equivalent maps the position to a status that can include `DEAD_POSITION_UNWINNABLE_QUICK`, but the move pipeline never throws it.

### Phase 2 — Tentative: drop auto-fivefold and auto-75-move termination

**Not committed yet — captured for discussion.** The same line of reasoning applies to FIDE 9.6.1 (fivefold) and 9.6.2 (75-move): both are automatic terminations under the current model, but playing on past either is harmless (same outcome arguments as dead position). Dropping the auto-termination would unlock tests the corpus cannot currently express — sixfold, sevenfold, longer-than-75-move sequences after the 75th — that today either fail with `GAME_ALREADY_ENDED` or have to live as legacy fixtures.

The trade-off the user flagged: if these stop being automatic terminators, consumers that *do* want to surface them have to query the predicates themselves (`isFivefoldRepetition()`, `isSeventyFiveMove()`). The signal is "presented twice" in the sense that the consumer first sees the rule fire and then has to keep asking on subsequent moves whether the game has progressed past it. That is a real ergonomics cost for the typical consumer.

If adopted, the work mirrors Phase 1: remove the corresponding checks from `ValidateNewMove`, leave `isFivefoldRepetition()` / `isSeventyFiveMove()` as queryable predicates. The 75-move-rule fixtures currently parked in `pgnParser/legacy/common/beyond/` (~30 files) move back into the regular corpus.

**To decide before any code lands.** Listed here as a follow-on so the question stays visible alongside Phase 1, not because it's settled.

### Phase 3 — Corpus and test cleanup

**Step 3.1** — Legacy fixtures that exist only because their game played past a dead position move back into the regular corpus. The relocation under `pgnParser/legacy/common/beyond/` was specifically to keep `TestSetupPgnCorpusNotPlaysBeyondAudit` green; if dead position is no longer an auto-terminator, the audit no longer flags them. Identifying the affected files comes out of grepping the legacy tree for fixtures whose recorded termination is `DEAD_POSITION_*`.

**Step 3.2** — `TestLegacyPgnParsePlaysBeyondAudit`'s `EXPECTED` map and the expected-count constant update accordingly. Any test that asserts on `GameStatus.DEAD_POSITION_UNWINNABLE_QUICK` being thrown from the move pipeline switches to asserting on the queryable predicate.

**Step 3.3** — `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md` "Notable features" if the auto-detection is called out there, and `specification.md` §3.1 ("FIDE rule fidelity and game termination") get the table updated: dead position moves from "automatic" to "queryable" (and same for fivefold / 75-move if Phase 2 lands).

### Phase 4 — Release artifacts

**Step 4.1** — Version bump (TBD; this is binary-incompatible if the `Board` constructor signatures with the `detectDeadPositionUnwinnable` flag are removed). `CHANGELOG.md` entry above the current release. `tasks.md` section marked done.

### Why before the python-chess release

Reactivating python-chess as the primary cross-validation reference means matching what python-chess actually does. python-chess does not auto-terminate on a dead position; it exposes the query and lets the caller decide. Aligning the library's termination model with python-chess's first makes the cross-validation pass cleaner (fewer "we say game-ended, python-chess says still-playable" disagreements that have to be papered over in the bridge).

---

## Future release — python-chess primary cross-validation + PGN/FEN test coverage expansion

The third release. Reactivates the python-chess test path (currently dormant), makes python-chess the main move-test reference, and expands PGN import/export test coverage — especially the FEN-anchored cases that `chesslib` cannot exercise.

### Context

The project historically tested against python-chess via `GeneratePythonTestCases.java`, which generates a Python test script from clean-chess fixtures. **That generator exists in the codebase but there is no active test that runs the generated Python script** — the comparison pipeline is dormant. Reactivating it is part of this release.

Carlos's `chesslib` (`LibraryCarlosBoard`) cannot import PGN from a non-initial-position via the `FEN`/`SetUp` tags. That gap is why python-chess becomes the *primary* cross-validation reference after this release. `chesslib` is retained as a second witness — having two independent oracles is more valuable than having one.

### Pattern recommendation — generation-based, not live invocation

- A Python script using python-chess generates expected outputs (legal moves, FEN, SAN, LAN, repetition counts, halfmove clock, dead-position verdicts) for a battery of fixtures, writes to a fixed file path.
- Java tests read the file and compare to clean-chess output.
- The Python script runs only when fixtures are added or regenerated, **not** during `mvn test`.
- Chess outputs are deterministic per input; cached reference data doesn't go stale.

### Discussion items to settle before coding

- [ ] Inventory exactly what python-chess will be used as reference for: legal-move generation, SAN/LAN, FEN, repetition counts, fifty-move clock, threefold/fivefold, dead-position (does python-chess support this directly or via heuristic?), CHA-style unwinnability (it doesn't — that stays unique to clean-chess).
- [ ] Decide: gradual migration (both `chesslib` and python-chess as references during transition) or hard cutover. Lean: gradual — keep `chesslib` as a second witness permanently.
- [ ] Document the toolchain requirement: contributors need Python 3 + `pip install chess`. Goes in `setup.md`.
- [ ] Plan the regeneration workflow: how is "I added a fixture; now regenerate the python-chess-expected outputs" triggered cleanly? Maven goal? Script? Make target?

### Reactivation work

- [ ] Audit `GeneratePythonTestCases.java` — current state, what it produces, what's still wired up after the dormancy period
- [ ] Decide and document the file format for stored expected outputs (JSON? line-based? CSV?)
- [ ] Refactor (or replace) the generator to produce the agreed format
- [ ] Build the Java-side consumer: read the expected-outputs file, compare to clean-chess output, fail loudly on mismatch
- [ ] Migrate at least one cross-validation test from `chesslib` to python-chess as a proof-of-concept

### python-chess as primary reference

- [ ] Migrate cross-validation tests from `chesslib` to python-chess for the surface python-chess covers
- [ ] Keep `LibraryCarlosBoard` as a second oracle — do not delete; two independent witnesses is the right shape

### PGN import/export test coverage expansion

The area `chesslib` cannot test and python-chess can: PGN imported from a non-initial position via the `FEN`/`SetUp` tags. Currently the test corpus skews toward initial-position games; expanding here is overdue, and python-chess being primary makes it feasible for the first time.

- [ ] Catalog the missing PGN-import-with-FEN test cases: short examples per side-to-move, per castling-right combination, per en-passant target square, per non-trivial half-move-clock / full-move-number
- [ ] Cross-validate each against python-chess output
- [ ] PGN export coverage: round-trip tests for PGN files that started with a non-initial `FEN` tag — both archival and semantic export modes
- [ ] FEN export coverage: round-trip from python-chess-generated FEN strings (real-world FEN exporters produce inputs the strict parser may not love)

---

## Future release — publish to Maven Central

The capstone release. Publish to Central only when the library has stabilised — every prior release done, identity questions settled, and any tasks that surface during the prerequisite work itself addressed first. Maven Central artifacts are immutable: once published, an artifactId+version pair lives forever in the public record. The bar for moving from JitPack to Central is therefore "we are confident this artifact represents the project well, indefinitely."

### Prerequisites — must be true before any Central work begins
- [ ] DeepSquare release complete (Auto-CHA + Zobrist + pawn-wall classifier + foundational refactors)
- [ ] Bitboard release complete (performance acceptable, differential-test harness green)
- [ ] python-chess primary + PGN/FEN coverage release complete
- [ ] Rename decision resolved — clean-chess → DeepSquare or final name. Once published, the artifactId is permanent
- [ ] Every task that surfaces during the prerequisite releases has been addressed (re-evaluate this list at the moment of starting; the bar is "library is mature")

### Sonatype Central Portal setup
- [ ] Create Sonatype Central account at https://central.sonatype.com, sign in via GitHub
- [ ] Verify the `io.github.dlbbld` namespace (auto-verified for GitHub-signed-in users — no domain needed)
- [ ] Generate a GPG key, publish it to a public keyserver (e.g. `keyserver.ubuntu.com`), record the keyID
- [ ] Configure `~/.m2/settings.xml` with Sonatype Portal credentials and GPG passphrase

### `pom.xml` — Central-required metadata
- [ ] `<groupId>` → `io.github.dlbbld` (currently `com.github.dlbbld`, the JitPack convention)
- [ ] `<version>` → strict semver (`4.x` → `4.x.0`)
- [ ] Add `<name>`, `<description>`, `<url>` (link to GitHub repo)
- [ ] Add `<licenses>` block (GPL v3, with full URL)
- [ ] Add `<developers>` block
- [ ] Add `<scm>` block (`connection`, `developerConnection`, `url`)

### `pom.xml` — required plugins
- [ ] `central-publishing-maven-plugin` (the new Sonatype Portal plugin — *not* the deprecated `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` / OSSRH that older tutorials still document)
- [ ] `maven-gpg-plugin` for artifact signing
- [ ] `maven-javadoc-plugin` to produce a javadoc jar (`maven-source-plugin` is already present)

### JAR-content audit at publish time
Whatever ships in the first Central artifact is in the public record forever. Re-audit at publish time.

- [ ] Re-audit `src/main/resources` end-to-end: anything developer-facing, test-only, or environment-specific should not ship
- [ ] Re-audit `src/main/java` for any utility classes that should have been package-private rather than public (folds the residual API-surface work in if not already done by the API-surface release)
- [ ] (The test-fixture message keys are handled in the cleanup follow-through release; this audit is the safety net for anything similar that surfaces between now and publish)

### First publish + workflow
- [ ] Update README: drop the JitPack `<repositories>` block, leave only the plain Maven dependency snippet (no extra repository declarations needed for Central)
- [ ] Drop the JitPack URL and any related framing from README and other docs
- [ ] First publish via the Central Portal — staged release, manual approval the first time
- [ ] Verify the artifact appears at https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.dlbbld/...
- [ ] Document the per-release workflow (version bump → tag → `mvn deploy` → Portal release) in `setup.md` under a new "Releasing" section, or in a dedicated `release.md`

### Post-publish
- [ ] Decide whether JitPack stays available in parallel (free, harmless) or should be deprecated by removing the JitPack publish hook
- [ ] (Optional) Add a Maven Central status badge to the README

## Pseudo release - Role-inversion — `StaticPosition` subtree moves to `src/test/`

Will not be released, just implemented for proof of the role independency of StaticPosition and BitBoard.
The end-state described in the Project Invariant: the `StaticPosition` subtree (record, `StaticPositionUtility`, `com.dlb.chess.squares.*` consumer subset, `AbstractLegalMoves` + `*LegalMoves` consumers in `com.dlb.chess.moves`, `UnwinnabilityMaterial`) physically moves from `src/main/java/` to `src/test/java/` and becomes the permanent differential-test oracle from that point on. **Not deleted. Relocated.**

The role inversion: today the high-level board is a peer of the bitboard in `src/main/`; afterwards, it lives strictly above (test-side of) the bitboard. Production speaks only the bitboard. The high-level board exists to assert the bitboard is correct.

### Audit findings (run at the start of 10.0.0)

~25 src/main classes outside the relocation subtree still consumed `StaticPosition` after 10.0.0 shipped. They must be ported off before the physical relocation:

- **Public API:** `Fen` (record with a `StaticPosition` field), `Board.getStaticPosition()`, `InsufficientMaterialUtility.calculateIs*` overloads, `ChessRuleAnalyzer.analyze*` overloads.
- **FEN layer:** `FenParserAdvanced`, `FenBoard`, `FenMaterialCount`, `FenConstants.FEN_INITIAL`.
- **SAN layer:** `StrictSanParser`, `LenientSanShapeNormalize`, `SanValidateDestination`, `SanValidateLegalMoves`, `SanValidatePieceExists`, `SanPieceCheck`.
- **Board layer:** `ValidateNewMove`, `BoardMaterial`, `UciMoveUtility`.
- **Unwinnability layer:** `SemiOpenFilesUtility` (StaticPosition variant remains alongside its bitboard sibling), `UnwinnableFullAnalyzer` / `UnwinnableQuickAnalyzer` (Fen pass-throughs).

Plus the public-API decisions: the `Fen` record reshape is binary-incompatible; `Board.getStaticPosition()` removal breaks API. Both are fine — no downstream consumers exist (no Maven Central publish yet), so the project is free to break.

### Design decisions settled

- **`Board.getStaticPosition()`: dropped entirely.** No deprecated derived view. After this release no `src/main/` class references `StaticPosition`.
- **Test-tree package layout: original package names under `src/test/java/`.** No `reference/` package rename. Smaller diff; matches the established pattern (`LibraryCarlosBoard` already lives in `com.dlb.chess.board` on the test source root alongside the production `Board.java`). The relocation is purely physical.
- **Square geometry tables stay in `src/main/`:** `OrthogonalRange`, `DiagonalRange`, `RayUtility`, all `*EmptyBoardSquares` in `com.dlb.chess.squares`. Pure data, useful to the bitboard layer.
- **Non-StaticPosition `com.dlb.chess.moves` stays in `src/main/`:** `CastlingUtility`, `EnPassantCaptureUtility`, `KingCastlingLegalMoves`, `PromotionUtility`, `StandardMoveUtility`, `PawnDiagonalMoveUtility`.

### Phases — each its own commit-sized step, suite green after each

- ✅ **Phase 0** — `tasks.md` restructure for the role-inversion release: 8-phase plan spelled out, design decisions captured.
- ✅ **Phase 1** — Port the SAN layer off `StaticPosition`. Six classes: `StrictSanParser`, `SanValidateLegalMoves`, `SanValidateDestination`, `SanValidatePieceExists`, `SanPieceCheck`, `LenientSanShapeNormalize`. New bitboard helpers on `BitboardPosition`: `kingSquare(Side)`, `potentialToSquares(Square, long)`, `isOwnPiece(Square, Side, PieceType)`. Bitboard overload of `EnPassantCaptureUtility.calculateIsPotentialEnPassantCapture`. Differential test for `potentialToSquares` against `AbstractPotentialToSquares.calculatePotentialToSquare`.
- ✅ **Phase 2** — Ported `ChessRuleAnalyzer`, `InsufficientMaterialUtility`, `BoardMaterial`, `ValidateNewMove`, `UciMoveUtility`, `SemiOpenFilesUtility` (StaticPosition variant) off `StaticPosition`.
- ✅ **Phase 3+4** — Ported the FEN parser / serializer off `StaticPosition` and reshaped the `Fen` record: dropped `staticPosition`, added `bitboardPosition`. `FenParserAdvanced` builds `BitboardPosition` directly. `Board(Fen)` reads `fen.bitboardPosition()`. Binary-incompatible.
- ✅ **Phase 5** — Dropped `Board.getStaticPosition()` and `getStaticPositionBeforeLastMove()` entirely. No deprecated view. All `src/main/` readers ported off.
- ✅ **Phase 6** — Physical `git mv` of the relocation subtree to `src/test/java/`:
  - `src/main/java/com/dlb/chess/board/StaticPosition.java` → `src/test/java/com/dlb/chess/board/StaticPosition.java`
  - `src/main/java/com/dlb/chess/common/utility/StaticPositionUtility.java` → `src/test/java/com/dlb/chess/common/utility/StaticPositionUtility.java`
  - `src/main/java/com/dlb/chess/squares/{AbstractAttackedSquares, AbstractToSquares, AbstractPotentialToSquares, AbstractRangeSquares, *AttackedSquares, *PotentialToSquares, *RangeSquares}.java` → test tree (consumer subset only; geometry tables stay in main)
  - `src/main/java/com/dlb/chess/moves/{AbstractLegalMoves, *LegalMoves}.java` → test tree (consumer subset only; `CastlingUtility`, `EnPassantCaptureUtility`, `KingCastlingLegalMoves`, `PromotionUtility`, `StandardMoveUtility`, `PawnDiagonalMoveUtility` stay in main)
  - `src/main/java/com/dlb/chess/unwinnability/UnwinnabilityMaterial.java` → test tree
  - Plus production-side cleanup: dropped all `StaticPosition` overloads from `CastlingUtility`, `EnPassantCaptureUtility`, `StandardMoveUtility`. `BitboardLegalMoveFactory` inlines its own castling generation. `BitboardPosition.INITIAL_POSITION` / `EMPTY_POSITION` rewritten as standalone bit constants. New `StaticPositionBridge` in `src/test/java/com/dlb/chess/bitboard/` carries the round-trip helpers; `BitboardPositionUtility` (production-side) holds only `StaticPosition`-free helpers.
  - Original package names preserved (no `reference/` rename). After Phase 6 no `src/main/` code imports `StaticPosition` or any relocated consumer; doc comments may cross-reference, code may not.
- ✅ **Phase 7** — Formalized the permanent differential-test layer in `specification.md` (new §4.1 *Piece placement: bitboard in production, mailbox as test oracle* and §6.1 *Differential testing of the bitboard backend*) and here. Project policy from this point on: every primitive on `BitboardPosition` is asserted against the relocated `StaticPosition` oracle on every fixture in the corpus, for every supported release going forward.
- ✅ **Phase 8** — Release artifacts: version bump 10.0.0 → 11.0.0 (`pom.xml`, `README.md` ×2), `[11.0.0]` `CHANGELOG.md` entry above `[10.0.0]`.

## Backlog — captured but unscheduled

Items here are not assigned to any release. Captured so they don't get lost; revisit if/when scope or motivation aligns.

### Records carry data, not behavior — sweep for violations
The project rule (documented in `coding-conventions.md`): records carry data; domain logic that operates on them lives in dedicated utility / service classes. Permitted on a record: compact-constructor validation, `Comparable` when ordering is intrinsic, and language-provided `equals` / `hashCode` / `toString`. Domain-operation methods are not.

Surfaced by the unused-code-detector pass on `StaticPosition`: the record carries multiple non-data methods — `createChangedPosition` (three overloads), `isPawn`, `isOwnPawn`, `isOpponentPawn`, `isOwnKing`, `isOpponentKing`, almost certainly more. Some have only test callers (suggesting test scaffolding), some have production callers, one (`isOwnKing`) has zero callers anywhere.

- [ ] Catalog every non-permitted member on `StaticPosition` and assign a disposition per member: delete (no callers anywhere), move to a test-side helper that **takes** a `StaticPosition` rather than duplicating it (test-only callers), or move to a `StaticPositionUtility` (production callers).
- [ ] Sweep every record under `src/main/java` for the same pattern. Records to check include at least `Fen`, `Tag`, `PgnGame`, `LegalMove`, `MoveSpecification`, `StaticPosition`, plus any other top-level `record` declarations under `src/main`.
- [ ] Apply the dispositions; verify only the permitted member shapes remain on each record.
- [ ] Naturally folds into the API-surface reduction release, since most "move to utility" relocations open the door to making the utility itself package-private.

## Obsolete

Items deemed no longer worth pursuing. Captured so the decision is visible.

### Replace `EnumConstants` constant interface
`com.dlb.chess.common.constants.EnumConstants` is a `public interface` whose only purpose is to expose ~90 `public static final` aliases for `Square.*`, `Side.*`, `Piece.*`, `PieceType.*`, `Rank.*`, `File.*` so implementing classes inherit them unqualified. This is the classic "constant interface" anti-pattern (Effective Java item 22): interfaces should describe a contract/behavior, not be a convenience-inheritance vehicle for constants. The mechanism reads as beginner Java and leaks an internal vocabulary choice into the public type surface — `ChessBoard extends EnumConstants` is the clearest symptom (the chess contract has nothing to do with how implementers prefer to spell `Square.E4`). Used by 43 files under `src/main` plus tests.

Replacement strategy options, depending on intended audience:
- public-API constants: `public final class EnumConstants` with `public static final` fields and a private constructor (callers `import static`)
- internal-only: make package-private and split closer to where they belong (domain-grouped, e.g. `BoardSquares`, `PieceLetters`)
- derived enum collections: prefer local `EnumSet` / `ImmutableSet` factories in the utility that needs them, or dedicated package-private constants classes by domain

- [ ] Pick a replacement strategy (default lean: package-private utility class with `import static`, since the constants are internal vocabulary and the audit reduces public surface anyway)
- [ ] Drop `extends EnumConstants` from `ChessBoard` regardless of strategy — the interface should not carry constants
- [ ] Convert the 43 src/main call sites + tests to static imports
- [ ] Folds naturally into the API-surface reduction release, since most "move to utility" relocations open the door to making the utility itself package-private.

### Profound-level square geometry — promote single-step calculations to lookup tables
The codebase already uses lookup tables for the geometry that matters — `OrthogonalRange`, `DiagonalRange`, `KnightEmptyBoardSquares`, `BishopEmptyBoardSquares`, `RookEmptyBoardSquares`, `DiagonalLineUtility`. Single-step instance-style methods on `Square` (`calculateLeftSquare`, `calculateLeftDiagonalSquare`, `calculateAheadSquare`, etc.) and `File` / `Rank` are the calculate-on-demand holdouts in an otherwise table-based codebase. The "calculate" form has a deeper testing problem: any independent test implementation faces a definitional regress ("left of E4 from White is D4 — but what does *left* mean if not what `calculateLeft` returns?"), which is how `Square.calculateIsLeftDiagonalSquare` ended up as a tautological method that tested itself against itself.

The fix is to promote these single-step relationships to data:
- `Map<Square, Map<Side, Square>>` (or `EnumMap<Square, EnumMap<Side, Square>>`) constants for left, right, ahead, behind, left-diagonal, right-diagonal
- The "has" predicates collapse to `map.containsKey(...)` or `value != NONE`
- The map is built once at class load; tests verify the table by inspection or via python-chess cross-reference (folds into the existing python-chess backlog)
- The bug surface shrinks to one place: the table-builder

Marked obsolete because the bitboard release will replace this whole layer of square arithmetic with bit-level operations; doing the `EnumMap` refactor first would be throwaway work. The definitional-regress testing problem also dissolves once `BitboardPosition` exists as an independent oracle.

- [ ] Inventory single-step `calculate*` methods on `Square` / `File` / `Rank` that are pure square→square (or square+side→square) lookups
- [ ] Replace each with a precomputed `EnumMap` constant + a thin accessor
- [ ] Generate the expected tables either by hand-curation or by python-chess cross-reference (latter is preferred once the python-chess infrastructure lands)
- [ ] Drop the algorithm-vs-algorithm test patterns; tests become "look up in production table, compare to reference table"
- [ ] **Companion concern — bloated lookup-table implementations.** `PawnDiagonalSquares` is 826 lines of generated code (per-square `addWhiteA1`, `addWhiteA2`, … methods) to express what is conceptually "for each pawn from-square, the 0–2 diagonal capture squares." The same shape recurs across the `com.dlb.chess.squares.emptyboard.*` family (`Knight`, `Bishop`, `Rook`, `Queen`, `King`, `PawnOneAdvance`, `PawnTwoAdvance`, `PawnAnyAdvance`). These tables are correctly precomputed, but their implementation should be a single `static {}` initializer that loops over `Square.REAL` and computes each entry via simple file/rank arithmetic — not hundreds of method-per-square stubs. Replacing them collapses ~thousand-line files to dozens of lines while preserving the precomputed-table API. Same theme as the main bullet: keep the lookup, sane the implementation.
